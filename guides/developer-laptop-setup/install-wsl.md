# Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

## WSL1 or WSL2
If the Windows 10 device is capable of running it, WSL2 is preferred over WSL1.  This is because WSL2 is built using a full Linux kernal and is optimised for size and performance.  It also solves many of the networking and Docker integration challenges that were present in WSL1.

## Installation
Follow the below Microsoft guide to install the distro of your choice. The Ubuntu distro is recommended.

The guide also explains how to upgrade WSL1 to WSL2.

## Troubleshooting
### VPN
WSL1 frequently regenerates `/etc/resolve.conf` and places the VPN host IP entry last.  For VPN DNS to resolve, it needs to be first in the list.

In order to prevent this you need to follow the instruction in the comment on the first line of the file (_# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, remove this line._) and also move the VPN host IP entry to the top.
