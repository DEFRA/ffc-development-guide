# Pact-Broker CLI
 
The Pact Broker is an application for sharing of consumer driven contracts and verification results. It is optimised for use with "pacts" (contracts created by the Pact framework), but can be used for any type of contract that can be serialized to JSON. https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker
