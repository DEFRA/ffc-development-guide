# Backlog management

## Sizing tickets
Teams may find it beneficial to score tickets to help plan their sprints and calculate delivery estimates. There are several techniques that could be applied to aide with this including:
- Scrum Poker
- T-shirt sizing
- Large, uncertain, small
- The Bucket system

## Board format
Whether following a Scrum or Kanban approach, teams should have a board to support agile delivery. A board helps team visualise, prioritise and plan their work.

As well as a virtual board in Jira it would be advantageous to have a physical board mirroring the content.

The columns within the board should be decided by the team and integrated upon if opportunities to improve delivery are identified.

The below represents a good starting position for a board.

### Backlog
Issues that need refinement. Scrum teams may find it better to omit this column and only include issues that are in the current sprint on the board.

### To do
Refined issues with full description and acceptance criteria. The team have agreed that these stories are a current priority and are ready to be worked on.

### In progress
Issues currently being worked on. These issues should be assigned to a team member. Team members should work on one story at a time where possible to manage Work in Progress (WIP). Kanban teams may impose a WIP limit to control the throughput of work.

### Review
Issues that have been completed by the team and are ready for review. The review be undertaken by another member of the team who confirms that all acceptance criteria has been met and the issue is done. For code based issues, this review is likely to be a [code review](../standards/code-review.md).

It is the responsibility of the person who worked on the task to find a reviewer. The issue should be reassigned to the reviewer who becomes the new owner.

Teams should not pick up new issues if there are outstanding issues to review to prevent a bottleneck.

### Done
Issues that have been delivered and successfully reviewed.
