# Setup command line tools

Mac users who prefer to have a more traditional Unix toolkit accessible to them through the Terminal may wish to install the optional Command Line Tools subsection of the Xcode IDE. 

This is possible installing the entire Xcode package, no developer account is required either.

## Install command line tools

```
xcode-select --install
```
