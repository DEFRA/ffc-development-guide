# Install Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm Charts are
the package definitions which help you install and upgrade Kubernetes
applications.

Helm 3 was released in [November 2019](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/).

Until then, Helm 2 had been the default version of Helm. There are significant
differences between the two versions, one of the most substantial being the
removal of [Tiller](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/glossary/#tiller). This has
resulted in a much easier installation process along with improving the
management experience.

All charts created by FCP are done so using Helm 3.

## Installation

Installation instructions vary based on OS. Refer to the official docs for
[details](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
