# Mac Setup Scripts
Mac users may want to consider the use of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as their go-to package manager which simplifies the installation of many packages, desktop applications, command line tools etc. by using a single command for the majority of if not all installations.

[A set of scripts](https://github.com/rtasalem/dffc-mac-scripts) have been created and are free to use by anyone to aid setting up a Mac for the first time. Please refer to the repository for full instructions. 

These scripts cover typical installations required to develop on the FCP Platform and CDP:
- Command Line Tools for Xcode
- Homebrew
- kubectl 
- Azure CLI 
- Helm
- Snyk CLI
- GitHub CLI
- Python
- Pip
- pre-commit 
- detect-secrets
- .NET SDK
- Docker
- Visual Studio Code

The scripts *do not* cover neostandard or Node Version Manager (NVM).

There is also an optional script which installs a range of mostly desktop applications and other packages that may be useful for day-to-day development.
