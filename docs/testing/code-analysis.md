# Code analysis

SonarCloud will provide static code analysis on all repositories regardless of technology choice.

In addition to SonarCloud, any JavaScript code is also linted using [StandardJs](https://standardjs.com/).

There is no linting used for C# in the programme at present.

All repositories should be added to the Defra organisation as a project in [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/defra/projects).
