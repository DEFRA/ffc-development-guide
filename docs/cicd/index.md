# CI/CD pipelines
The capabilities of FFC are underpinned by DevOps CI/CD pipelines providing cloud agnostic tooling with build and release automation through Jenkins.

Jenkins standards and guides can be found [here](jenkins.md).

## Pipeline design
The below diagrams show the current design for a CI/CD pipeline that embraces a DevOps culture.

**Note that these designs are currently in draft state and will be further refined through engagement with GIO, CSC, Security and emerging needs of the FFC digital services**
