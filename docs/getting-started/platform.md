# Platform

## FCP Platform
To support rapid, highly assured delivery, the programme has delivered common Azure environments, PaaS components, delivery pipelines and supporting tools.

These are collectively referred to as the `FCP Platform`.

All FCP developed services are currently deployed to the FCP Platform.  

Guidance for use of the FCP Platform is hosted within this repository.

## ADP Platform
Following the success of the FCP Platform, Defra has created a Defra wide iteration known as the `ADP Platform`.

The ADP Platform is built on the same principles as the FCP Platform, but takes into account lessons learned throughout the lifetime of the FCP Platform to provide a better experience for teams utilising it.

It is the long term intention of the programme to migrate all FCP Platform hosted services to the ADP Platform once it becomes mature enough to provide feature parity.

Guidance for use of the ADP Platform is hosted within the [ADP Documentation](https://defra.github.io/adp-documentation/).

## Choosing a Platform
When starting a new project, the choice of platform should be made in consultation with the FCP Architecture team.  However, it is expected that all new projects will be hosted on the ADP Platform unless there is a compelling reason not to.

Early engagement with the ADP Platform team is encouraged to ensure that the platform is suitable for the project's needs.
