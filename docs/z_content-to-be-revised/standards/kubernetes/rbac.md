# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
FFC clusters enable RBAC through `RoleBinding` Kubernetes resources.  Users must be added as Cluster Admins to access Kubernetes through tools such as [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) or [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).

CCoE can provide this access to users on request.
