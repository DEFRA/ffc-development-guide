# Farming and Countryside Programme (FCP) Development Guide

This is a repository of standards and supporting guidance for all developers working within the Farming and Countryside Programme (FCP).

The purpose of the standards are to ensure that delivery supports the Architecture Vision set out by the programme and better enable developer agility and mobility through consistent patterns and practices.

The guide also provides help and support for common setup and problem solving.

## Defra standards

The standards and guidance contained here is intended to be an FCP context specific layer over Defra's wider development standards.

This guide assumes that Developers already understand and follow these [core standards](https://github.com/DEFRA/software-development-standards/).

## Getting started

The best place to start as a new developer joining FCP is to read the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.
