# Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

# Installation
Follow the below Microsoft guide to install the distro of your choice.

Note: WSL frequently regenerates `/etc/resolve.conf` and places the `192.168.0.2` entry last (it needs to be first in the list). This in turn causes name resolution problems when connecting to the local kubernetes cluster. In order to prevent this you need to follow the instruction in the comment on the first line of the file (_# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, remove this line._) and also move the `192.168.0.2` entry to the top.
