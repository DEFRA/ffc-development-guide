# Installing AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open source tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell.

An installation guide is available within the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html).
