# CI/CD pipelines
The capabilities of FFC are underpinned by DevOps CI/CD pipelines providing cloud agnostic tooling with build and release automation  through Jenkins.

# Standards
Pipelines should be scripted within a Jenkinsfile and source controlled with the service it relates to.  The Groovy syntax should be used.

# Using Jenkins locally
## Installation
Jenkins can be installed locally by following this [official guide](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).  The recommended method is to use the Blue Ocean Docker image.
