# Technology Stack
All technology choices are in line with Defra Digital’s [Tools Radar](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TR/boards/630/roadmap)

These choice have been used as a baseline to help decide which technologies to build services with. Where there are gaps not covering FFC needs we have aligned ourselves to the FFC architectural vision, Cloud Centre of Excellence recognised patterns and lessons learned from other digital teams.

When developing services, teams must use the following technology stack.  Where a new need is not covered by the below technology stack, collaboration between FFC architecture and the Tools Authority must take place to agree how to fill the gap.
