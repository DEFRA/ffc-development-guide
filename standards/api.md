# API Standards
## Rest

Teams need to document their API using OpenAPI 3.0 Specification which can be found [here] (https://swagger.io/specification/).

GDS states that "The open standards board recommends that government organisations use OpenAPI version 3 to describe RESTful APIs" you can read [more about the GDS guidelines on RESTful APIs] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3)

The OpenAPI file should be kept in a docs folder in the top level of the folder and named openapi-<version>.yaml
