# Backlog management
All FFC teams follow an agile delivery approach. Teams should use whichever agile methodology best fits their delivery, for example Scrum, Kanban etc.

The [GDS Service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) provides guidance for agile delivery.

If teams are unclear which methodology to adopt, they should start with vanilla Scrum and iterate as appropriate. Teams looking for help getting started with Scrum can follow this [training series](http://scrumtrainingseries.com).

All teams should manage their backlog in Azure DevOps within the [`DEFRA-FFC`](https://dev.azure.com/defragovuk/DEFRA-FFC) project. The backlog should be managed as a single backlog for the team, not a backlog per product.
