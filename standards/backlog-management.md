# Backlog management
All FFC teams follow an agile delivery approach. Teams should use whichever agile methodology best fits their delivery, for example Scrum, Kanban etc.

The [GDS Service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) provides guidance for agile delivery.

If teams are unclear which methodology to adopt, they should start with vanilla Scrum and iterate as appropriate. Teams looking for help getting started with Scrum can follow this [training series](http://scrumtrainingseries.com).

All teams should manage their backlog in a tool such as Jira, Azure DevOps Boards or Trello.

## Issue format
- issues are appropriately categorised as either an Epic, Story, Task or Bug
- issues are titled as a problem statement
- issues include a full description of their purpose
- issues include acceptance criteria to clearly explain when the issue is done

## New issues
- new issues are added to the backlog
- if an issue relates to technical debt, a reference to a `Technical Debt` epic is added
- issues should be added outside the current sprint in an estimated priority order, this priority order should be regularly reviewed as a team

## Backlog refinement
Before an issue can be worked on, it must be refined to include a full description and acceptance criteria. This must be agreed with the team before it is committed.

The format for refining a ticket is:

```
WE NEED ...
SO THAT ...
IT'S DONE WHEN ...
```

Acceptance criteria specified in the `IT'S DONE WHEN` section is measurable and testable.
